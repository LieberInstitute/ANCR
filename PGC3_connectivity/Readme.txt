### Computing and evaluating gene connectivity to PGC3 risk loci genes (Figures 5,6):
* PGC3conn_Fig5.R : Compute ranked connectivity to PGC3 SCZ risk genes (and null sets), taking into account connectivity to background. (Fig 5). 
* PGC3conn_CRISPRa_null_Fig5.R : Evaluate association between PGC3 connectivity (for real and null sets) and Zscore of response to CRISPRa activation of PGC3 eGenes (from Townsley et al). (Fig 5).
* [Townsley.et.al_CRISPRaPGC3_data](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.29.486286v2.supplementary-material) : Published data of Zscore of response to CRISPRa activation of PGC3 eGenes : see their Supplemental Data 1.
* acrosskme_genes_Fig6A.R : Compute per-gene connectivity to SCZ risk based on across-module association between kME and median magma. (Fig 6).
